# Continuous Integration
Continuous integration (CI) is the process of automating the build and testing of code every time a team member commits changes to version control.

## Pillars of Continuous Integration
**Version Control**:

- Git.
- Apache Subversion.
- Team Foundation Version Control.

**Package Management**:

- NuGet.
- npm.
- Chocolatey.
- HomeBrew.
- RPM.

**CI System**:

- Azure DevOps.
- TeamCity.
- Jenkins.

**Automated Build Process**:

- Apache Ant.
- NAnt2.
- Gradle.

## Benefits of Continuous Integration
- Improving code quality based on rapid feedback.
- Triggering automated testing for every code change.
- Reducing build times for quick feedback and early detection of problems (risk reduction).
- Better managing technical debt and conducting code analysis.
- Reducing long, complex, and bug-inducing merges.
- Increasing confidence in codebase health long before production deployment.
