# Choosing the right project
## Greenfield / Brownfield projects
### Greenfield
- Clean slate,
- More accessible at the beginning,
- Avoiding existing bbusiness processess that don't align with project needs.

### Brownfield
- Existing codebase,
- Siginificant ammount of technical debt,
- Existing teams.

## Systems of record / Systems of engagement
### Systems of record
- Provide the truth about data elements,
- Evolving slowly and carefully.
  
For instance, a banking system.

### Systems of engagement
- Modified regularly,
- More exploratory,
- Use experimentation to solve new problems.

## Identifying groups to minimalize initial resistance
|Group name|Description|
|---|---|
|**Canary users**|Voluntarily test bleeding edge features as soon as they're available.|
|**Early adpoters**|Voluntarily preview releases, considered more refined than code that exposes canary users.|
|**Users**|Consume products after passing through canary and early adopters.|

## KPIs
Most commonly used KPIs:

- Efficiency (Server to Admin Ratio, Application usage & performance),
- Faster outcomes (Deployment frequency, speed, size, **Lead Time**),
- Quality and security (Deployment failure rates, bug report rates, mean time to detection, availabilty),
- Culture (Employee morale, retention rates).
