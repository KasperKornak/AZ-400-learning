# Introduction to DevOps
## Shortening cycle time
- Working in smaller batches,
- Using more automation,
- Hardening release pipeline,
- Improving telemetry,
- Deploying more frequently.

**Validated learning** - Data gathered during cycle of the project which is factual and actional. The more often you deploy, the more opportunities arise to gather validated data.

## Exploring DevOps
The goal is to shorten the cycle time, to deploy the new code as fast as possible.

### Some DevOps concepts
1. **Continuous Integration** drives the ongoing merging and testing of code, leading to an earl finding of defects. Other benefits include less time wasted fighting merge issues and rapid feedback for developers.
2. **Continuous Delivery** to production and testing environments enables organizations quickly fix bugs.
3. **Verison Control** enables team to efficiently work on projects.
4. **Agile planning** is used for project management:
   - Planning and isolating work into sprints
   - Managing team capacity and help teams to adapt quickly
5. **Monitoring and Logging** to quickly find problems and collect data needed for feedback.
6. **Public and Hybrid clouds**.
7. **Infrastructure as Code** makes automation of configuring environments easy.
8. **Microservices** are used to isolate small use cases into reusable, independent units.
9. **Containers** are much more lightweight than virtual machines.
