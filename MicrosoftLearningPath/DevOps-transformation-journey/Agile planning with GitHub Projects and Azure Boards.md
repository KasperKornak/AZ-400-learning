# Agile planning with GitHub Projects and Azure Boards
## Project Boards 
There are three different types of project boards:

- **User-owned project boards**: contain issues and pull requests from any personal repository.
- **Organization-wide project boards**: contain issues and pull requests from any repository that belongs to an organization.
- **Repository project boards**: scoped to issues and pull requests within single repository.

You can use templates to quickly set up a new board:

|Template name|Description|
|---|---|
|Basic kanban|To do, In progress, Done columns.|
|Automated kanban|Automatic moves between To do, In progress, Done columns.|
|Automated kanban with review|Cards automatically move between: To do, In progress, and Done columns, with extra triggers for pull request review status.|
|Bug triage|Triage and prioritize bugs with: To do, High priority, Low priority, and Closed columns.|
